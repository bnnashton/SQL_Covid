# SQL_Covid
 SQL queries (and data) to analyze trends in COVID-19. SQL queries completed as part of Alex Freberg's data analyst bootcamp. "Covid_query" contains all queries used for analysis (Note: at the end of the file I used a CTE approach and a temp table approach to achieve a similar analytic goal as an educational device), while "Tableau Visualizations" contains only queries used to build the dashboard final product.
